"Hey baby yes this is me 2021 veer her for you... i know i wasnt good as this veer and so i am here to apoogize to you
for one last time cua maybe we never meet again. so yeah i was kinda jealous and over protective sorrry for that but it was all my love in 
my heart for u for once and always it was never ought of doubts. but okay and secondly im sorry for being so clingy ik i always wanted u 
infront of my eyes never allowed u to live ur life ur style, this veer is so silent ik he doesnt stop u from anything 90 percent of times i
hope thats wht u like jaan. i am sorry for scolding u too much and being so bad lol, it was never that i didnt found u same as me but it was
just because i never wanted u in problems and u saw how many my controlling and scolding behaviour saved u from certain things but... fine
i hope this veer accepts whatever u do without questioning u at all he must would've asking general questions and all but yeah he isnt like
me even a percent and i give my word to u in that he is calm silent and afraid.... yeah he is afraid haha strange but yea he is this answer
will be given by him itself. and yeah sorry for loving u so deeply that i never allowed to go to any guy around u cuz i always knew i was 
replacable and see i was right i am replaced by this new veer haha.... out of everything i did panda ik i was wrong but i will give u a word
i wouldnt have ever saw another women by even my side eye the much he did cuz for me u were the only women who existed after mom and sis and

this veer is so much better then me and yeah panda... this veer cant love u like i did i can bet our love life on this ... anyway this was all
i wanted to tell u i hope u accept this it doesnt care that u accept my apology or not but i wont return cuz.. i have heard from him how much
